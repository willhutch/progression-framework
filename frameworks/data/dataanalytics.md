### About our engineering progression frameworks
The engineering progression framework is a tool to help everyone:
- make development and career plans
- talk about what we‚Äôre looking for from Globallers in a consistent way

The framework is a compass, not a GPS.

It's meant to be helpful. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans!

### How does it work?
The framework covers all the things we‚Äôre looking for from Globallers. You'll see these 4 elements:
- üõ† Mastery - Your team-specific knowledge, including technical knowledge and anything else needed to become a master of your skillset
- üß† What you know - Your knowledge of Global and how you approach and overcome problems
- ü§ù How you do it - How you communicate, share ideas and work with others - keeping things simple and respecting others - thinking about how your actions make others feel
- üí• The impact you make - How you take pride in your work and strive to achieve projects which have the biggest impact


### Things to keep in mind
- There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Global as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, technical leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths
- The framework represents a career‚Äôs worth of progression, people shouldn‚Äôt expect to fly up it in 18 months!
- Career progression isn‚Äôt an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.
- This isn‚Äôt a checklist ‚Äì it‚Äôs possible to progress up a level without showing all the behaviours in that level.
- There could be further levels on top (eg ‚ÄòInventor of Intergalactic Space Travel‚Äô), but we won‚Äôt add them until we need them.

### Give us your feedback!
We want your feedback!!

We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.
