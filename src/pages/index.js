              Welcome to the home of the Tech & Digital Department‚Äôs Career Pathways Framework here at Global.  This
              site has been built to provide clearer direction and clarity for those at Global, for areas that they can
              focus on for development, and to provide a tool to support open and fair conversations between managers
              and their reports.
            </DescriptionText>
            <DescriptionText>
              This Framework has been developed through a range of contributors from across the department, and is a
              living reflection of their work - further suggestions are very much welcomed!  Please suggest your changes to
              Will or Anahita, or make amendments in a pull request on the GitHub site
            </DescriptionText>
            <DescriptionText>
              We‚Äôre gradually building this out across teams within the department, so if you can‚Äôt see your department
              on here yet - stay tuned or get involved in supporting its development yourself!

                      On the sidebar, you‚Äôll find our ‚ÄúGeneric‚Äù attributes.  These are attributes which we see as being
                      core to all Globallers in Tech & Digital.  Navigating the levels in the top right will show how
                      these attributes change as Globallers develop their careers.

                      Each team has it‚Äôs own section, where you‚Äôll see the ‚ÄúGeneric‚Äù attributes
                      alongside each team‚Äôs own set of ‚ÄúMastery‚Äù attributes. These attributes
                      are specific to mastering a particular skillset associated with a team.
                </DescriptionText>
                <DescriptionText>
                      All attributes (including the ‚ÄúGeneric‚Äù ones) are designed to provide direction,
                      but also to constantly evolve.  So please do make suggestions and changes! We want
                      Globallers to be the best they can be, which only happens with everyone‚Äôs input!
